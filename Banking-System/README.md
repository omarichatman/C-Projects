# Banking-System
The objective of the program is to organize accounts at a bank. The program will receive all
the account information from a data file "account.dat". The program will read that information
and prompt the user for ATM instructions, such as withdrawal, deposit, and checking the balance
for their savings and checking. The user will sign-in using their information and use the
functions if their information is stored in the data file. Users will be able to make new
accounts and the new information will be saved to a data file "updated_acount.dat".
